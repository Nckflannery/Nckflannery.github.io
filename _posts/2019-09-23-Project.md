# US Population and Agricultural Trends

Recently, while looking through datasets I stumbled upon an interesting and somewhat shocking bit of information. Since 1960 the population of the U.S. has increased from around 179 million to around 330 million people. However, in this same span of time the amount of agricultural land in the U.S. has dropped from around 450 million hectares (a measure equaling 100 square meters) to 405 million hectares. (Fun fact, this difference of 45million hectares is almost exactly the size of Sweden!)

At first glance this may not seem like much, only around a 10% decrease over 50-60 years. Yet, when taking into account that the population has increased by nearly 85% in that same timeframe, you may ask (as I did) "How are we feeding everyone!?" I decided to do some investigating to try to shed some light on what is really going on here.

## So what is really going on here? 
First, let's take a look at how much we import per year for some of the most widely consumed items in the U.S.:

As we can see, over the last 40 years the amount of food that we import has skyrocketed. Even if we exclude fruits from this list, which climbed from around 2million tonnes (1000kg or 2205lbs.) per year to an astronomical 19million tonnes, we can see that almost every other item at least doubled in amount over this time period as well.
