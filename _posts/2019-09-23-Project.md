![US Population vs Land Used for Agriculture](/img/PopGraph2.png)

Recently, while looking through datasets I stumbled upon an interesting and somewhat shocking bit of information. Since 1960 the population of the U.S. has increased from around 179 million to around 330 million people. However, in this same span of time the amount of agricultural land in the U.S. has dropped from around 450 million hectares (a measure equaling 100 square meters) to 405 million hectares. At first glance this may not seem like much, only around a 10% decrease over 50-60 years. Yet, when taking into account that the population has increased by nearly 85% in that same timeframe, you may ask (as I did) "How are we feeding everyone!?" I decided to do some investigating to try to shed some light on what is really going on here.

## So what is going on: 
### Imports

### Price of farmland

### Consumption amounts

### Yields

### GE

## What does this mean for the future?

### Projection

## Conclusion
