# US Population and Agricultural Trends

Recently, while looking through datasets I stumbled upon an interesting and somewhat shocking bit of information. Since 1960 the population of the U.S. has increased from around 179 million to around 330 million people. However, in this same span of time the amount of agricultural land in the U.S. has dropped from around 450 million hectares (a measure equaling 100 square meters) to 405 million hectares. (Fun fact, this difference of 45million hectares is almost exactly the size of Sweden!)

At first glance this may not seem like much, only around a 10% decrease over 50-60 years. Yet, when taking into account that the population has increased by nearly 85% in that same timeframe, you may ask (as I did) "How are we feeding everyone!?" I decided to do some investigating to try to shed some light on this.

## So, what *is* really going on here?

First, let's take a look at how much we import per year for some of the most widely consumed items in the US:

As we can see, over the last 40 years the amount of food that we import has skyrocketed. Even if we exclude fruits from this list, which climbed from around 2million tonnes per year to an astronomical 19million tonnes (that's around 42 BILLION pounds), we can see that almost every other item at least doubled in amount over this time period as well. This may suggest, perhaps, that the amount of farmland is decreasing due to lack of necessity. With so much more being imported, maybe there isn't enough of a market to support so much farmland.

## Maybe there just isn't as much desire for farmland?

To check this theory, I looked into the average cost per acre of farmland:

[Data gathered from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home)

What I found was that the cost of farmland in the US increased sharply as the years passed. There are a multitude of factors affecting the value of any land in the US, but I believe one large contributor is the consolidation of the agriculture business as a whole. For the purposes of this study I didn't want to go too deep into agricultrual economics (you could spend hours and hours researching and looking into the changes over the last 50 years and only skim the surface of the subject!). With smaller farms starting to disappear and huge agricultural conglomerates (Monsanto, ADM, Cargill alone hold a large percent of the market) taking over, the question of price becomes less interesting and the questions of how and what are we farming become more intriguing. To answer these questions, I decided to follow them up with a look into American dietary changes. 

## How eating habits have changed over the last 60 years

I created this graph to demonstrate clearly where the American diet has diverged and in what ways it has stayed relatively constant:

It is clear that while Americans are consuming more of every group besides dairy and eggs, we are consuming a great deal more of oils & fats, meats, sugars, and cereals & grains.
