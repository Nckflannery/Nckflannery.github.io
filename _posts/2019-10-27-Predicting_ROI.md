# Predicting Return on Investment

Have you ever thought of investing on Lending Club? They say there are no guarantees in life, and investments are no different.
However, I created an app that attempts to predict the return on investment for any loan. The model for these predictions was created from
data on over 2.2 million loans. It is designed to be as accurate as possible using only the features available to a potential invester at the
time of investment.
